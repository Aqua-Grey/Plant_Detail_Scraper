Miridae Mobile Nursery - Plant Photo Collection

Welcome to the Miridae Mobile Nursery project! This repository provides a streamlined Python-based tool to help you retrieve photographs of plants from iNaturalist based on a curated plant list. Using a simple plants.txt file, this script connects to the iNaturalist API to download images for each listed plant, allowing for easy access to reference photos directly tied to your nurseryâ€™s offerings.


Project Overview

This project aims to bridge the gap between plant lists and visual references, making it easier for enthusiasts, educators, and nursery operators to display plant images aligned with their inventory. With a focus on native plants, the Miridae Mobile Nursery project not only serves as a practical utility but also supports educational outreach and public engagement with local flora.


Features
    Simple Input: Place plant names in plants.txt, and the script takes care of the rest.
    Automated Image Retrieval: Leverages the iNaturalist API to fetch and download images for each plant.
    Customizable: Easily adapt the code for specific formatting or extended information needs, depending on your project goals.


How to Use
    Prepare a list of plant names in a text file (plants.txt).
    Run the script to fetch images directly from iNaturalist.
    Enjoy a directory of curated plant images matching your list.
